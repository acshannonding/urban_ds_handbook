# networks 2


According to six degrees of separation two individuals, anywhere in the world, can be connected through a chain of six or fewer acquaintances. This means that while Sarah does not know Peter, she knows Ralph, who knows Jane and who in turn knows Peter. Hence Sarah is three handshakes, or three degrees from Peter. In the language of network science six degrees, also called the small world property, means that the distance between any two nodes in a network is unexpectedly small.
