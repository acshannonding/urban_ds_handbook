# Formalities
## Prerequisites & Target Audience
This book is intended to serve as a quantitative introduction to the study of cities, covering key areas of Urban Science & Urban Data Science. Readers are expected to have some existing fluency in Python (many excellent introductions exist[TODO: add some links here]). A background in general high school mathematics should prove a sufficient starting point; though we will cover some advanced topics, our focus will be more on interpreting results than deducing complex proofs (though we will point the adventerous reader to them).<br><br>
Ideal readers include data scientists with an interest in expanding their toolset and learning more about urban systems, urban planners interested deepening their quantitative chops, students of either field (or of the wonderful niche field of urban data science!). If you're just looking for an introduction to data science, and never plan to leave the countryside, this book can likely get you pretty far, but you can likely find more general books better suited.

## A note on data sources
All data sources used for calculation in the book are stored in the book's Github page [TODO: link]. Documentation for original sources is provided on Github, with all data being pulled on October 3, 2024.<br>

There is much truth to the joke: "Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data and 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data"
```
Data is provided in a cleaned, easily-accessible way, enabling us to focus just on the analytical aspects of highlighted in much of the book. In real life, it is rarely this easy to get the data you need. An entire section towards the end of the book is devoted to a variety of methods of collecting, storing, and cleaning data.
